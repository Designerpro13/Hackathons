# InfiltraFox- A Guide for Security Analysis

**Abstract:** The rapid expansion of web applications has increased the risk of security vulnerabilities. The "InfiltraFox" project aims to develop a Firefox browser extension that performs basic HTML analysis to detect potential attack vectors such as SQL Injection (SQLi) points, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and cookie manipulation risks. This extension will offer a toggle between Red and Blue Team modes, providing both offensive penetration testing guidance and defensive security recommendations.

## 1. Introduction

With the rise of cyber threats, penetration testing has become a critical component of cybersecurity. Existing tools such as HackTools and MITRE ATT&CK extensions provide security professionals with pre-built exploit frameworks and references. However, there is a gap in lightweight, in-browser analysis tools that can automate the identification of common vulnerabilities. The "InfiltraFox" aims to bridge this gap by providing real-time, browser-based security analysis.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop a Firefox extension that scans webpage HTML for potential security weaknesses.
- Identify login forms that could be vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- Detect inline scripts and event handlers for potential XSS exploits.
- Analyze cookies for improper security flags (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Provide a user-friendly interface with a toggle for Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) analysis.

## 3. Technical Implementation

The extension is built using the WebExtensions API, which ensures compatibility with modern browsers like Firefox.

### 3.1 Core Components

- **Manifest File (manifest.json):** Defines permissions, background scripts, and user interface elements.
- **Background Script (background.js):** Handles user interactions and fetches webpage HTML.
- **Content Script (content.js):** Injects into the webpage to scan for security vulnerabilities.
- **Popup UI (popup.html + popup.js):** Displays analysis results and attack/defense recommendations.

### 3.2 Vulnerability Detection Techniques

- **SQL Injection Detection:**
  - Identifies `<form>` elements with `method="POST"` and `input type="password"` fields.
  - Checks for missing input sanitization mechanisms.
- **XSS Detection:**
  - Analyzes inline JavaScript (`<script>` tags) and event attributes (`onload`, `onclick`, etc.).
  - Flags unsafe JavaScript execution contexts.
- **Cookie Security Analysis:**
  - Retrieves document cookies and evaluates their security flags.
  - Highlights potential risks due to missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, or `SameSite` attributes.

## 4. Usability and Real-World Applications

- **Security Professionals:** A quick, browser-integrated scanning tool for preliminary assessments.
- **Developers:** Helps identify security flaws during web development without relying on external penetration testing tools.
- **Bug Bounty Hunters:** Streamlines vulnerability hunting for common attack vectors.
- **Educators & Students:** Provides a hands-on learning tool for cybersecurity training.

## Conclusion

 The "InfiltraFox" browser extension provides a lightweight yet effective approach to detecting common web security vulnerabilities. By integrating Red and Blue Team methodologies, it serves as both an offensive testing tool and a defensive security guide. Future enhancements could include deeper integration with external scanning tools and real-time API-based security assessments.
