### **InfiltraFox** 🦊 – A Pentester's Browser Extension  

#### **Overview**  

InfiltraFox is a **Firefox browser extension** designed to help penetration testers and security professionals perform **basic web security assessments**. It scans **HTML source code** to detect **common vulnerabilities** and suggests **attack vectors and defensive measures** based on real-world exploit techniques.  

---

### **Features**

✔ **Automated HTML Source Scanning** – Detects security flaws in login pages, scripts, and cookies.  
✔ **Vulnerability Detection** – Identifies potential **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cookie Manipulation** risks.  
✔ **Red/Blue Team Mode** – Switch between:  

- **Red Team (Offensive)** – Recommends **exploitable attack vectors** based on findings.  
- **Blue Team (Defensive)** – Suggests **security hardening techniques** to mitigate risks.  
✔ **Smart Attack Vector Filtering** – Prioritizes relevant **pentesting commands and tools**.  
✔ **Integration with HackTools & MITRE ATT&CK** – Provides additional insights and methodologies for security testing.
