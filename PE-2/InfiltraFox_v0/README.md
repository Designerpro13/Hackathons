# **InfiltraFox** ðŸ¦Š â€“ A Pentester's Browser Extension

## Overview

InfiltraFox is a **Firefox browser extension** designed for security professionals to conduct **rapid web security assessments**. It analyzes webpage HTML to identify potential security vulnerabilities and provides actionable recommendations for both offensive and defensive security approaches.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Vulnerability Detection**
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Identifies vulnerable form inputs and login pages
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Detects unsafe script contexts and DOM injection points
  - **Cookie Security**: Analyzes cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

- **Dual-Mode Interface**
  - **Red Team Mode**: Suggests exploitable attack vectors and pentesting techniques
  - **Blue Team Mode**: Provides defensive recommendations and security hardening measures

- **Security Analysis Tools**
  - HTML source scanning with intelligent pattern matching
  - Form and input field analysis
  - Script execution context evaluation
  - Cookie security attribute verification

## Installation

### Development Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/infiltrafox.git
   cd infiltrafox
   ```

2. Load the extension in Firefox:
   - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
